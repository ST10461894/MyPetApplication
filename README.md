Introduction

The App presented below is a Tamagotchi app. The creation of Tamagotchi first originated in Japan by Akihiro Yokoi as a toy made to allow users to take care of a virtual pet Delgado [2021].  Similarly, the app does so by allowing end users to take care of a virtual pet on their smartphones or digital devices. Users must play with, feed and attend to the virtual pet in order to keep them happy and healthy. The App features a welcome page which leads its users into the game, where they are able to feed, play and clean their virtual pet whilst keeping an eye on the pet’s hunger, health and cleanliness status.
Background
This app is made using Kotlin, a general-purpose development language which is mainly used for Android mobile application development. It is a statically typed objected-oriented programming language which is interoperable with Java class libraries, Android and the Java virtual machine (JVM) It was originally designed to improve on Java programming language and is usually used together in conjunction with Java (Lutkevich 2024). Present Below are details of the Tamagotchi app made with the specifications requested.  

App interface
 
The app features two screens. The first screen welcomes the user to the app and has a picture of the virtual pet named “Scooby” who welcomes users from his home. Scooby belongs to the cockapoo dog breed which is a mix between the Cocker Spaniel and poodle dog breeds. They are playful, intelligent, and easy to train, and they make fun companions for families or any individual looking to add an affectionate pup to their life Dog-Academy [2024].
 
 Below the image there is a button “get started” which then leads users onto the second screen.

 
 The second screen above features 3 buttons being “feed”, “play” and “clean”. Just below the buttons are the stats to indicate how the pet is feeling. By looking at the figures users can have an understanding of the pets well-being. Whenever a user presses the feed button the “Hunger” status value will decrease by 1% and an image will display the pet having a meal. Whenever a user presses the clean button the clean status value will increase by 1% and an image will display the pet with a cleaning bottle. Additionally, whenever a user presses the play button the “Happy” status value will increase by 1% and an image will display the pet playing with a toy. The higher the percentage figure shown in the fields of “clean” and “happy” the better the mood of the pet within the field. Whereas the lower the percentage figure shown in the field of Hunger the less hungry the pet would be. 
However, the pets physical and emotional conditions are subject to change due to inactivity. If the user remains inactive on the app for a period of 3hours then the field of “hunger” will increase by 1% and the fields of “clean” and “happy” will decrease by 1%. This is made to allows users to regularly use the app to check on the well-being of the virtual pet. Additionally, this principle can also be applied to a real-life situation with a real pet so as to regularly spend time with it in order to build a stronger connection. 


Input & Functionality

The app code background makes use of the different topics discussed in learning units 1 to 5, these being if else statements input and output, variables, data types, login, decisions, loops and arrays. All these various functions have been implemented to provide the app an engaging user-interface aswell as an appealing design made to captivate the end users as they interact with its functions. As presented in the code below the Array function is used. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable instead of creating separate variables for each existing value Kotlin [2024].  
 
As seen above the array function was used to create the list of multiple values into one variable. These values stored are the “feed button”, “clean button” and “play button”. In this case the values have been stored under the “buttons” variable.  

GitHub

GitHub is a online software tool that allows users to store the source code for a project aswell as track the all the changes that were made to the code. It allows developers to collaborate on their projects more effectively by providing the tools for managing the potential conflicting changes made from multiple developers. Each of the file changes are recorded as commits, which are organised into branches, providing a structured history of the development of the project. This system allows developers to work on different branches independently then later merge their changes back ti the main branch (Badkar 2023) It is a great tool allowing developers to change, improve and adapt software from public repositories for free and is regarded as the most popular platform for collaboration on coding projects (Lutkevich 2024).  All related files and source code for the app is stored on GitHub for developers to view and make corrections where necessary.  



Conclusion

The Tamagotchi app created is great way to provide users especially children with the responsibilities that come with having a pet before they decide to purchase one. Overall, the interface is simple and easy for any first time user to understand and navigate right from their first use of the application. It is also a great playmate to keep children occupied without having to worry about the burdens that come with having a physical pet such as bathing & cleaning up messes caused. Although real pets are fun, it takes more time and devotion to take care of them, which is not the case with virtual pets. The app is therefore a great stepping stone for users to utilize before they consider getting a physical pet.
